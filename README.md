## Phase-field simulation of dendritic growth using Random Walk Algorithm
- 2D simulation of growth of single dendrite driven by thermal and solute gradients using phase-field method
- Far field evolution governed by a Random Walk algorithm
- Model for dendritic growth based on work performed by Ryo Kobayashi (Read paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727899390120P))
- Extension of work performed by Mathis Plapp and Alain Karma for thermal dendritic growth (Read paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0002015.pdf))
- Parallelization of code using OpenMPI for accelerated simulation (in progress)
- Code written in C
